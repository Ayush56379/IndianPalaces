<h2>History of City Palace Jaipur</h2>
<p>
The City Palace was constructed by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in the early 18th century when he shifted his capital from Amber to Jaipur. 
Over the years, successive rulers added new structures, courtyards, gardens, and decorative elements. 
The palace complex consists of Mubarak Mahal, Chandra Mahal, Diwan-i-Khas, and Diwan-i-Aam.
</p>
<p>
The Chandra Mahal still serves as the residence of the royal family, while other parts are open to visitors as museums displaying royal costumes, weapons, manuscripts, and artifacts.
