<h2>History of Golconda Fort</h2>
<p>
Golconda was originally built as a mud fort in the 12th century by the Kakatiya dynasty. 
Later, it was expanded and strengthened by the Qutb Shahi rulers in the 16th century.
</p>
<p>
The fort became the capital of the Qutb Shahi kingdom and grew into a major center for diamond trading.
</p>
<p>
Many famous diamonds such as the Kohinoor, Hope Diamond, and Darya-i-Noor were once stored and traded here.
